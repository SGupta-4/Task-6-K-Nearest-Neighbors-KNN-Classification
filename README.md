# 🧮 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task is to **understand and implement the KNN algorithm** for classification problems.  
We will use Scikit-learn to build the model, evaluate its performance, and visualize decision boundaries.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- **Scikit-learn** → KNN implementation, metrics, datasets  
- **Pandas** → Data handling & preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib** → Visualization (decision boundaries, results)

---

## 🚀 Steps Implemented
1. **Choose a dataset**  
   - Used the **Iris dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`.

2. **Preprocess the data**  
   - Normalized features using `StandardScaler` (important for distance-based algorithms).

3. **Train the model**  
   - Used `KNeighborsClassifier` from sklearn.  
   - Experimented with different values of **K**.

4. **Evaluate the model**  
   - Computed **accuracy**.  
   - Used **confusion matrix** for deeper evaluation.

5. **Visualize decision boundaries**  
   - Plotted decision regions (for 2D projections).

## 📊 Example Results
- Accuracy varies with the choice of **K**.  
- Small K → High variance (overfitting).  
- Large K → High bias (underfitting).  
- Decision boundary plots help visualize classification regions.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Iris Dataset** (from `sklearn.datasets`)  
- Features: `sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width`  
- Target: Species (`Setosa`, `Versicolor`, `Virginica`)
